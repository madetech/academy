# 3. Coding exercises

We will use Qualified to handle the coding exercies for candidates. It will involve three different exercies of varying difficulty. In previous years we've had plenty of applicants getting 100% across the board, though we will essentially score applicants based on:

- % complete of the coding exercises
- Variable and function/class/method names are readable and sensible
- Consistent code style and whitespace
- Avoids duplicate code
- Clear flow of code for solving the problem
- Not over-engineered/code complexity

While candidates are completing the coding exercises, we can offer a mentor, who they will be able to email to ask for clarification. Mentors are given the following advice:

> The following pointers may be useful when supporting a candidate
> 
> - Determine their exact problem
> - Help them to understand/breakdown the question
> - Help them to understand the constructs/structures they may need to answer the question

For the latter five points above, in Airtable, it would be good to track each with a separate boolean column so that a score can be calculated, and so we know which attribute has passed or failed. 

The latter five points above will also require a human review of the application. [@TODO if possible when reviewing the exercises in Qualified, can we remove any PII to avoid unconcious bias?]

[@TODO can we use the code complexity metric in Qualified as a scoring attribute?]

Once reviewed, the coding exercise can have an automated score assigned via a formula column in Airtable, using all 6 points as a scoring percentage.
