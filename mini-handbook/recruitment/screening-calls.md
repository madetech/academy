# 4. Screening calls

For any candidates that pass the threshold of the coding exercises (to be determined once we have some applicants complete the exercises), we can then arrange for a screening call, to be carried out by Canda, to seek out alignment on values and culture match. The call taker will use a simple scoring system for:

- Made Tech values
- XYZ

[@TODO just to make it a bit more objective, rather than just a "strong yes" - would be great to have a bit more information at this stage]

We will use a formula based on the call to score the candidate.

On the call, we want to give the Made Tech blurb and talk about how we work, the types of projects etc.

After the call, the candidate can either progress or be disqualified. When disqualifying, the candidate will be tagged in Airtable, and this can automatically:

- Send a disqualification email to the candidate via Drip

After the phone call, along with the scoring, summary notes need to be added based on the call, regardless of whether progression or disqualification. An column in Airtable will be available for this.
