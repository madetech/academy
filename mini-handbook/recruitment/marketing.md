# 1. Marketing before applications open

Using social media and other channels, we aim to build a buzz around the next academy, and steer people towards a email subscription campaign whereby we can then send out regular emails with updates, particularly around when applications are open.

Even after applications have opened, we'll continue to send out emails via the campaign, and potentially other Made Tech newsletters.
