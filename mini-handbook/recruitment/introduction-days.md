# 5. Introduction days

Based on the applicants at this stage, we need to decide which ones to invite to the introduction days based on:

- Application form
- Coding exercices
- Screening call

For each of the above areas, ideally we want to have a formula based score for each area, and then to have a consolidated single score made up of all three, so that selecting candidates for introduction days is as simple as ordering by overall score in descending order and selecting the highest scoring candidates.
