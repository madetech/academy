# Holiday

Please refer to the Made Tech Handbook for the full guidance on booking holidays: [Made Tech Flexible Holiday](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/master/benefits/flexible_holiday.md)

## Booking holiday

During the Academy, we recommend keeping holiday to a minimum. We are running a twelve week intense programme of learning and team working, any time off will mean that you will have a lot of material to catch up on. 

Feel free to book holiday for after the 12 week programme once you have successfully completed the Academy and you have received your Made Tech employment contract. 

## How much holiday should I book?

If you need to book time off for half a day or more, please book this in HiBob and inform your line manager. 

## Who approves holiday?

* Ask your team members if it's okay with them

* Ensure that the holiday is placed into HiBob

* Ask your Line Manager / Academy instructor
